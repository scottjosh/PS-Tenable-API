# PS-Tenable-API
A RESTful API for Tenable Software written in PowerShell


This is a project I am working on as time permits. Progress tends to come in fits and spurts as my time allows and is primarily focused on my needs first. Please feel free to report issues and I will do my best to address them as time permits but please do not use this module as part of a critical business process as it is still in development with no projected completion date.
